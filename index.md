Peter Flach has been Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bris.ac.uk) since 2003. An internationally leading researcher in the areas of mining highly structured data and the evaluation and improvement of machine learning models using ROC analysis, he has also published on the logic and philosophy of machine learning, and on the combination of logic and probability. He is author of [Simply Logical: Intelligent Reasoning by Example](https://book.simply-logical.space) (John Wiley, 1994) and [Machine Learning: the Art and Science of Algorithms that Make Sense of Data](http://mlbook.cs.bris.ac.uk) (Cambridge University Press, 2012).

From 2010 until 2020, Prof Flach was the Editor-in-Chief of the [Machine Learning journal](https://www.springer.com/journal/10994), one of the two top journals in the field that has been published for over 25 years by Kluwer and now Springer-Nature. He was Programme Co-Chair of the 1999 International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming, the 2001 European Conference on Machine Learning, the 2009 ACM Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, and the 2012 European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases in Bristol. He is a founding board member and current President of the [European Association for Data Science](https://euads.org). 

Prof Flach's research has been funded by EPSRC, MRC, TSB and the EU, among others. He is currently leading the Data Fusion and Data Mining work in the [SPHERE project](https://irc-sphere.ac.uk) funded by EPSRC, and Director of the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Interactive Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/interactive-ai/).
